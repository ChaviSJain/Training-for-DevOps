2.Understanding IP address and their Ranges, DNS SERVER

  IP ADDRESS

  - An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is like the digital home address of a device on a network.
  - It helps route data from one device to another (like mail from your laptop to a website server).
  - Every device on a network must have a unique IP to avoid delivery confusion.
  - There are two types of IP addresses:
    - Type	Format	Example
    - IPv4	Four numbers (0‚Äì255) separated by dots	192.168.1.1
    - IPv6	Eight groups of hexadecimal numbers	2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334
  - IP Address Classes (IPv4)
    - IPv4 addresses are divided into classes based on their leading bits and intended size:
      Class	Range of First Octet	Usage	            Example
      A	    1 ‚Äì 126	              Large networks	  10.0.0.1
      B	    128 ‚Äì 191	            Medium networks	  172.16.0.1
      C	    192 ‚Äì 223	            Small networks	  192.168.1.1
      D	    224 ‚Äì 239	            Multicast       	‚Äî
      E	    240 ‚Äì 255	            Experimental	    ‚Äî
  - Reserved IP Ranges (Private Networks)
    - These IPs are not routable over the public internet ‚Äî they're used for LANs (Local Area Networks):
    - Class A: 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255
    - Class B: 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255
    - Class C: 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255

  DNS SERVER
  - DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet's phone book. It translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (142.250.72.206).
  - How It Works:
    - You type www.example.com into your browser
    - DNS resolves it to the correct IP address
    - Your computer connects to that IP
    - Ex: Google,cloudflare,OpenDNS

SUBNETTING
- Dividing the network into smaller pieces.
- helps in managing traffic,improve security and isolate parts of the network.

3.How to run commands without using SUDO
  - By making using the docker group method
    - Docker runs as a system service in the background and access to its daemon is restructed for security purpose.
    - but users in the docker group are allowed to use the docker commands without the elevated priviledges.

  - Therefore, to add vboxuser to the docker group, we run the command 
  - " sudo usermod -aG docker $USER " 
    - usermod modifies user account
    - aG docker adds user to docker gorup
  - we then apply the group changes by running the commans
  - "newgrp docker"
  - we can now run docker commands without using SUDO.

4. Docker Compose
  - Docker Compose is like an orchestra conductor for your multi-container applications üê≥üé∂ ‚Äî it lets you define and run all your services with a single command using a YAML file.
  üì¶ What It Is
    - Docker Compose is a tool that:
      - Defines multi-container Docker applications (e.g., web server + database + cache).
      - Uses a docker-compose.yml file to describe each container‚Äôs:
        - Image or build instructions
        - Environment variables
        - Network and volume settings
        - Port mappings
  ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
    - Configuration: You write a docker-compose.yml file with all the services your app needs.
    - Launch: Run docker-compose up to spin up everything at once.
    - Teardown: Run docker-compose down to stop and remove the containers.

  üí° Why Use It?
    - Simplicity: One file, one command ‚Äî and your whole stack is up.
    - Consistency: Ensures identical setups across dev, staging, or CI pipelines.
    - Scalability: Add more services (Redis, Postgres, worker queues) easily.
    - Isolation: Keeps each service in its own container with clean boundaries.

  - Docker Compose is a tool that lets you:
    - Describe your entire app environment (services, networks, volumes) in one file (docker-compose.yml)
    - Start everything with just one command:
      - docker compose up
    - Previously we ran the command "docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always flask-docker-app" for our flask app , but now a Yaml file (docker-compose.yml" will have these details and we'll run the command for docker compose
      "docker compose up -d" 
    - Now this will :
      - Start your container in the background
      - Automatically restart it on reboot (because of restart: always)
      - Let you manage it with friendly commands like:
        - docker compose stop
        - docker compose ps
        - docker compose logs

5. OWASP 
  - OWASP stands for the Open Worldwide Application Security Project ‚Äî a nonprofit foundation focused on improving software security üåêüîê

  üß† What OWASP Does
     OWASP provides:
      - Freely available tools and resources for developers and security professionals
      - Educational materials like cheat sheets, guides, and training
      - Community-driven projects to raise awareness and improve security practices
  It‚Äôs widely respected in the cybersecurity world and often referenced in compliance standards like PCI DSS and NIST.

  üìä OWASP Top 10
     One of its most famous contributions is the OWASP Top 10, a regularly updated list of the most critical web application security risks. The latest version includes:

      Rank	Risk Category	                                Description
      A01	  Broken Access Control	                        Improper restrictions on user actions

      A03	  Injection	                                    SQL, NoSQL, and other code injection flaws
      A04	  Insecure Design	                              Flawed architecture or logic
      A05	  Security Misconfiguration	                    Default settings, exposed files, etc.
      A06	  Vulnerable and Outdated Components	          Using libraries with known issues
      A07	  Identification and Authentication Failures	  Weak login mechanisms
      A08	  Software and Data Integrity Failures	        Trusting unverified sources
      A09	  Security Logging and Monitoring Failures	    Poor visibility into attacks
