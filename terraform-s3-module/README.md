1.Terraform generates random ID → Ensures bucket name uniqueness.

2.S3 bucket created → With your chosen prefix + random suffix.

3.Public access block updated → Allows public access (required for the next step).

4.Bucket policy applied → Grants public read & write to everyone.

Final result:

You have an S3 bucket accessible to the public.
